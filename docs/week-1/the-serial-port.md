# The Serial Port

The [Arduino serial port](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/serial/) allows you to communicate between your Arduino board and your computer. Since this communication occurs [serially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) we call it the serial port.
