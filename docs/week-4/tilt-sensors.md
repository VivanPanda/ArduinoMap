# Tilt Sensors

Tilt sensors, or tilt switches, are simple components that detect tilt or orientation. They are simpler to use as compared to accelerometers, which makes them a quick and easy addition to our Arduino projects.

## How it works

Tilt sensors usually have a tiny metal ball inside which moves around. When the sensor is level, the ball rests in a position where there is no connection between the internal contacts. When the sensor is tilted past a certain angle, the ball rolls and connects the contacts, closing the circuit.

This ON/OFF behavior lets the sensor act like a simple switch. 

## Constructing your circuit

Components required:
- 1x Tilt switch
- Breadboard
- Your Arduino board
- Jumper wires
