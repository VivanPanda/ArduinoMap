# What Next?

**Congratulations! You've reached the end of the ArduinoMap curriculum.**

Over the past lessons, you've learned a lot about fundamental Arduino and electronic concepts, how to work with an assortment of modules and combine them to make exciting, unique things. 

You've applied your knowledge in projects, which not only equipped you with the skills necessary to build your own devices, but gave you creations to showcase with your friends and family!

## Looking ahead

But this is just the *beginning*. The world of Arduino is vast and full of possibilities. Since you now understand the basics of many input and output modules, you can combine them with each other in many ways to create your own projects! 

## New components

In your Arduino and electronics journey going forwards, you will come across many new modules including advanced sensors, displays and much much more. To learn about these new modules, use the principles taught in this curriculum by constructing a schematic and referring to datasheet's to understand how to work with new components. 

Take the techniques and principles you've learned here and let them help you when working on your own projects. Most importantly, enjoy the journey. Electronics is **meant** to be fun. 

Lastly, I'd like to thank you for being part of and dedicating your time to this course. I hope it has helped you. 

**Good luck!**
