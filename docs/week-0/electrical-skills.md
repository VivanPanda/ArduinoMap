# Electrical Skills

Before we learn about connecting components to our Arduino, we need to be familiar with some basic electrical engineering concepts. 

## What is a circuit?

In electronics, a circuit is a path which allows  charge to flow from a power source and back to the source, hence completing the loop.

### Voltage, current and resistance 

But what is electricity? Electricity is the flow of electrical charge. The three basic principles of electricity - voltage (V or E), current (I), and resistance (R) - can be understood in reference to the charge. 
- **Voltage** refers to the difference in charge between two points. This is why voltage is commonly referred to as **potential difference**.
- **Current** is the rate of flow of charge.
- **Resistance** is a measure of opposition to the flow of charge. 

:::tip
The water analogy is an effective way to understand these concepts.
- Water flow represents current.
- Water pressure represents voltage.
- Any resistance to the flow of water represents resistance.

### Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is a fundamental law in electricity which describes the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. This relationship can be expressed using the formula `V = IR`.
