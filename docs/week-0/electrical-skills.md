# Electrical Skills

Before we learn about connecting components to our Arduino, we need to be familiar with some basic electrical engineering concepts. 

## What is a circuit?


In electronics, a circuit is a path which allows electrical current to flow from a power source and back to the source, hence completing the loop.
