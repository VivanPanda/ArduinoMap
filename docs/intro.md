# Introduction

When I tried learning Arduino, it was an overwhelming and daunting experience. Unfortunately, I never found a resource that taught a beginner from the basics, helping them to develop good practices. 

The aim of this course is to provide a roadmap for the aspiring hobbyist to become familiar with the world of Arduino. By the end of the course, you will be able to play around with an assortment of modules that include sensors, actuators and displays to build cool, unique, and valuable projects. 

## Curriculum

Each week’s module involves lessons on software (programming), followed by lessons on hardware. Rather than hand holding you through the course’s content, I will provide links to documentation, datasheets, and other useful websites for you to explore and learn. 

Each lesson will have an introduction to the topic, followed by a lesson which can be followed. Lastly, each lesson will be coupled with an assignment: a problems, challenges, and questions to apply the knowledge you have learned.

## Mindset

I am a big advocate for [learning by doing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing), which encourages learning concepts **actively** rather than passively. Following tutorials is great; but it ultimately restricts you. If you get stuck, reach out on one of the many communities, forums and servers available to help you. Some friendly communities include:
- [Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/)
- [Arduino Discord Server](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4405329164178-Join-the-official-Arduino-Discord-server)

Let's dive right in!
