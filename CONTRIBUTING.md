## I Want To Contribute

### Minor Changes

To correct minor issues, you can open an issue or a PR to contribute. Some minor issues include:

- Typos or grammar errors
- Syntax errors
- Other small-scale changes. For instance, "I think this video in the `Next Steps` section would be a useful addition."

### Major Changes

Major changes have a larger impact on the curriculum and website. Examples of major issues are:

- Adding a new section to an existing lesson
- Adding a completely new lesson
- A new feature for the website

To get started working on a major change easily, open an [Issue](/issues/new) and wait for a response rather than submitting a pull request (PR). This is to prevent your time and work from going to waste if your proposal isn't accepted. 

#### Creating an Issue

If you will be working on suggesting a major change, create a new issue and read the issue template, using it to fill out all the sections appropriately. This allows your contribution to be dealt with quicker.
