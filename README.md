## About

Welcome to ArduinoMap!

ArduinoMap is a free, open source Arduino curriculum designed to help beginners build strong foundations and develop good practices from day one.

When I first tried to learn Arduino, it was an overwhelming experience. Most resources jumped ahead too fast or skipped the fundamentals. I struggled to find a clear, practical roadmap that would support beginners and aspiring hobbyists wanting to explore the world of Arduino.

ArduinoMap was built to change that.
